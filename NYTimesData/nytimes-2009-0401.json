She is survived by her husband, Michael Gaster, their sons, Toby, Jonah and Gabriel Gaster, her brother, David Sucher, cousins Diana and Roger Glassman. She touched many lives, leaving close friends who loved her dearly. A native NYer, she graduated from the H.S. of Music and Art, Barnard, and SUNY Stony Brook, where she received a Ph.D in English and published a well received study of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. (She later taught at Truman College in Chicago, where she lived for 30 years. Also a gifted musician and artist, she was a cantorial soloist leading high holiday services, sang and performed classical, popular, Yiddish, Ladino, and Renaissance music, and exhibited her paintings in many galleries. For her wonderful tireless spirit, her sense of humor and adventure, her relentless spiritual quest, her original and quirky intelligence and her loyalty to us all, she is already more than missed. Her memorial will be Sunday, July 19 at 2pm at Emanuel Congregation, 5959 N. Sheridan Rd., Chicago. Please see and add to her online obituary at www.legacy.com",

True, he was 90 years old, but he had been active, engaged -- and working -- until a few days ago, when he broke his hip and then died of pneumonia in the hospital. Mr. Bernstein was perhaps best known for two books he wrote at a stage in life when most people are retired: \"Against The Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk,\" and \"Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street.\" As my colleague Louis Uchitelle noted in his affectionate obituary, Mr. Bernstein was a firm believer in the efficient market theory -- the subject of my column last Saturday -- and especially the power of diversification, which he touted constantly. He founded The Journal of Portfolio Theory. Harry Markowitz, who was awarded a Nobel Prize, for, essentially, creating portfolio theory, was one of his heroes. Mr. Bernstein's last book, \"Capital Ideas Evolving,\" published two years ago, was an attempt (more successful than not) at incorporating some of the ideas of behavioral finance into the broader efficient market theory championed by the likes of Mr. Markowitz and Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago.",
