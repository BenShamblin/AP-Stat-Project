At the time Ms. Horne was hired by the Cotton Club in Harlem, in 1933, Duke Ellington was no longer performing there.

The photo above, from one of his Antarctic trips, is posted on his his Facebook page. The pasted-in penguin suited Diebold's sense of humor, said David Corcoran, one of his brothers and a longtime colleague of mine on the Science desk of The Times. [Here's a great photo gallery of 40 years of Diebold's activities, at sea and ashore.]",

Dunn ... argues that the furthest we can get behind the Gospels is to the underlying strata of Jesus as his earliest followers remembered him. That is as far as we can go. That is the Jesus who gave rise to the Christian faith, and that is the only Jesus worth pursuing ... Dale Allison, whom I consider the most knowledgeable New Testament scholar in the United States, is less sanguine and more cynical than Dunn ... After three decades of work in and around the historical Jesus, Allison sketches the variety of views about the historical Jesus and the supposed modern theory that if we put our heads together we will arrive at firm conclusions. Allison offers this depressing conclusion: \"Progress has not touched all subjects equally, and whatever consensus may exist, it remains mostly boring.\" Allison admits this about one of his own books on Jesus: \"I opened my eyes to the obvious: I had created a Jesus in my own image, after my own likeness.\" He's not done: \"Professional historians are not bloodless templates passively registering the facts: we actively and imaginatively project. Our rationality cannot be extricated from our sentiments and feelings, our hopes and fears, our hunches and ambitions.\" So, he ponders, \"Maybe we have unthinkingly reduced biography [of Jesus] to autobiography.\"",
