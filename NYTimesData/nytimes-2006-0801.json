      "lead_paragraph": "In the News Sections MAN OR WOMAN IN THE NEWS: A portrait of a central figure in a news situation. It is not primarily analytical, but highlights aspects of the subject's background and career that shed light on that figure's role in the current event. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: A writer's collection of several anecdotes or brief reports, often supplementing coverage of major news events like a summit meeting or an important trial. The items provide glimpses behind the scenes that flesh out the reader's sense of a major story. MEMO: A reflective article, often with an informal or conversational tone, offering a look behind the scenes at issues or political developments. The article (with a title like Political Memo, White House Memo or Memo From London) may draw connections among several events, or tell the reader who and what shaped them. JOURNAL: A sharply drawn feature article focusing on a place or event (and labeled with the place name, whether foreign, national or regional). A Journal is closely observed and stylishly written, often light or humorous in tone. It is intended to give the reader a vivid sense of a place and time. NEWS ANALYSIS: A close examination of the ramifications of an important news situation. It includes thorough reporting, but also draws heavily on the expertise of the writer. The article helps the reader understand underlying causes or possible consequences of a news event, but does not reflect the writer's personal opinion. APPRAISAL: A broad evaluation, generally by a critic or a specialized writer, of the career and work of a major figure who has died. The article often accompanies an obituary. REVIEW: A specialized critic's appraisal of works of creativity -- movies, books, restaurants, fashion collections. Unlike other feature writers, critics are expected to render opinions in their areas of expertise. NEWS-PAGE COLUMN: A writer's regularly scheduled essay, offering original insight and perspective on the news. The column often has a distinctive point of view and makes a case for it with reporting. (Columns in the news pages are displayed with the writer's name and the column's title inset into the text.) The news sections also present a number of regular feature articles that carry labels indicating the topics - for example, the Saturday Profile in the foreign pages and Market Place in Business Day. In the Opinion Pages EDITORIAL: A sharply written, generally brief article about any issue of public interest. Editorials are written by the editorial board of The Times, which includes the editorial page editor, the deputy and assistant editors, and a group of writers with expertise in a variety of fields. While the writers' opinions are of great importance, the editorials also reflect the longtime core beliefs of the page. Unlike the editors of the news sections, the editorial page editor not only reports to the publisher, but consults with him on the page's positions. Editorials are based on reporting, often original and in-depth, but they are not intended to give a balanced look at both sides of a debate. Rather, they offer clear opinion and distinct positions. EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A signed article by a member of the editorial board. These articles have a more distinct personal voice than an editorial. They often reflect personal experiences or observations, and may be written in the first person. These articles are not intended to be policy pronouncements, but do not contradict the board's positions. OP-ED COLUMN: An essay by a columnist on the staff of The Times, reflecting the opinions of the writer on any topic. Columnists are expected to do original reporting. Some travel extensively. Op-Ed columns are edited only for style and usage, not for content. Columnists do not submit their topics for approval, and are free to agree or disagree with editorial positions. OP-ED CONTRIBUTION: An article by a person not on the staff of The Times, reflecting opinions about a topic on which the author is an expert or has provocative and well-reasoned ideas. These articles, most of which are solicited by the editors, are not intended to reflect the positions of the editorial board. Indeed, the Op-Ed page is seen as a forum to air diverse and challenging viewpoints.",

Conservative candidates for several state government posts foundered as well (but others won). It seemed as though moderation had finally returned to this middlemost of American places. Even better: perhaps the country itself had turned the corner in its long and frustrating war over culture. I was as pleased as anyone else to hear the news. Could the conservative uprising in my home state finally have run its course? Fourteen years ago, the armies of the right came pouring out of Kansas' evangelical churches to protest abortion and all the other liberal plagues upon the culture, and they've had a big role in the state's Republican Party ever since. But it must be difficult to stay angry that long, especially when the crusade you signed up for is now a hairsplitting fight that your leaders have picked with the biology professors of the entire world. Could the faction's rank and file simply have given up, grown disgusted with the absurdity that their grand cause has become?",

A1 The hanging ended the life of one of the most brutal tyrants in recent history. An obituary. A10 Under heavy American pressure, the Iraqi government ordered two Iranians who had been detained in an American military raid to leave the country, Iraqi officials said, ending a bitter, nine-day political standoff. A9 Young Africans Pack Schools After two decades of sluggish growth in enrollment rates, sub-Saharan Africa's 45 countries find themselves with nearly 22 million more students who flooded their classrooms between 1999 and 2004. A1 Anti-Ethiopia Riots in Somalia Anti-Ethiopia riots erupted in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, while masked gunmen emerged for the first time on the streets, a day after Ethiopian-backed troops captured the city from Islamist forces. A4 Anorexia Debate in Brazil In less than two months, four young women have died in widely publicized cases of anorexia in Brazil, causing a national debate about body image and eating disorders in a country where eliminating hunger among the millions of poor has traditionally been an important cause. A4 Belarus Challenges Its Big Ally For Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, 2006 is ending as it began: in a dispute over prices and control of a pipeline in a neighboring country that is threatening the flow of natural gas to Europe. But this time, the price increase was levied on a Russian ally, Belarus. A5 NATIONAL A12-16 Plan to Bolster Security In Harbors Falls Short A Coast Guard plan to combat terrorism by creating the equivalent of an air traffic control system in the coastal waters off Miami, a test for a nationwide effort, has fallen far short of expectations. A14 For Families, Costly Care Families have always looked after their elderly loved ones. But never before in history has old age lasted so long or been so costly, compromising the retirement of baby boomers who were expecting inheritances rather than the shock of depleted savings. A1 A Ray of Hope for Diabetics There are at least 21 million diabetics in the United States, and health officials have begun to despair of combating the disease. But amid this gloom, a public health experiment in Asheville, N.C., is something of a ray of hope, an example of the battle that can win results and save lives in the face of a disease that has resisted quick-fix solutions. A1 Private Service for the Fords The first day of public mourning for former President Gerald R. Ford began in Palm Desert, Calif., much the way his post-White House life did here 30 years ago -- privately, absent of pomp, a small-town affair writ large by history more than family intent.

A14 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Expensive and Unused, Security Doors Written Off Nineteen technologically advanced security doors that New York City bought for nearly $1 million have spent five years inside a Rikers Island warehouse and will soon be headed for secret destinations in countries that are American allies in the war on terror. The doors are being given away after three failed attempts to auction them off. B1 Debit Card Helps Immigrants New Labor, a nonprofit workers center in New Brunswick, N.J., is giving special debit cards to hundreds of immigrants who do not have checking accounts or credit cards and often face high check-cashing fees and frustrating obstacles in paying bills. B1 Religion Journal B7 Neediest Cases B2 SPORTSSATURDAY D1-8 Weiss Denies Link to Giants Notre Dame's football coach Charlie Weis called his connection to a possible opening with the New York Giants ''ridiculous'' during a news conference in New Orleans. His strong language does not keep Weis from topping lists of potential replacements for Giants Coach Tom Coughlin, whose job is in jeopardy. D1 OBITUARIES A17 Fernand Nault One of Canada's foremost dance figures, who followed up a 21-year career at American Ballet Theater with artistic leadership of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens and with prolific choreography that ranged from ''The Nutcracker'' to ''Tommy,'' his 1970 hit rock ballet, he was 85, one day short of his 86th birthday. A17 BUSINESS DAY C1-9 Apple Board Clears C.E.O. Apple Computer said a committee had found that its chief executive was not responsible for the improper dating of stock options.
