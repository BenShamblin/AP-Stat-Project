When the Book Review first approached Sante about the assignment, he said he had always wanted to write something about Leary. Why? ''Because I'm interested in the 1960's,'' he explained in an e-mail message, ''and that time is now sufficiently distant that things are coming out, the location of the buried bodies, so to speak.'' Starting in 1968, Sante commuted from New Jersey to high school in Manhattan. ''Nearly every day I bought underground newspapers, from all over the country, at newsstands. They usually cost a quarter. I was a very critical under-age observer of the scene. As a kid of that time, I was checking everything out, including psychedelics, which fascinated me almost as much as they scared me.''",

(VH1) MY FAIR BRADY: WE'RE GETTING MARRIED -- His former television mother, Florence Henderson, wasn't all that supportive of his relationship with a flighty model more than half his age. Still, that didn't stop Christopher Knight, still best remembered as Peter, the middle brother, on ''The Brady Bunch,'' from proposing to Adrianne Curry. Tonight, the couple (above) tie the knot in a ceremony tinged with Goth and try to tighten the gap between them. 7 P.M. (NBC) TOM BROKAW REPORTS: SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL -- Mr. Brokaw travels to Jackson, Miss., just brushed last year by Hurricane Katrina, to report on race and poverty 40 years after the civil rights movement. 8 P.M. (ABC Family) FALLEN -- In this two- hour drama based on a series of books by Tom Sniegoski, an 18-year-old orphan (Paul Wesley) discovers his fate - and ventures where angels fear to tread. 8 P.M. (Lifetime) OBITUARY -- Josie Bissett plays a journalist whose colleagues start to question her sanity when she comes upon a succession of murder victims for whom she has already read obituaries. 9 P.M. (13, 49) MISS MARPLE, SERIES II: THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY -- Miss Marple (Geraldine McEwan) finds a stunning-looking corpse (Timothy Dalton of James Bond fame, above, with Ms. McEwan) awaiting her when the owner of the mansion where she's staying during a snowstorm turns up with a knife in his chest and a smile on his lips. And what's that? It seems someone has a message for her. 9 P.M. (NBC) MISS UNIVERSE 2006 PAGEANT -- More than 80 beauties from around the globe fine-tuned their swimsuit, evening gown and interview skills to compete in this annual event in its 55th year, broadcast live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Nancy O'Dell and Carlos Ponce are hosts. Carson Kressley, ever the statistician, provides color commentary. 9 P.M. (HGTV) HGTV DESIGN STAR -- Ten aspiring interior designers pull tricks from their hard hats while living together as they compete for their own television series. First assignment: to decorate the New York townhouse they share. Martha McCully of InStyle magazine, Vern Yip of ''Trading Spaces'' and the fashion designer Cynthia Rowley judge the results. 10 P.M. (TLC) THE MESSENGERS -- This new reality series purports to find the country's next great inspirational speaker, with one caveat: participants must walk in the footsteps of those they hope to preach to, starting with a 24-hour stint living as a homeless person in Los Angeles (above).

So only hours after she died in an automobile accident near Valdosta, Ga., early on the morning of Feb. 27, her father, John Walker, logged onto her MySpace page with the intention of alerting her many friends to the news. To his surprise, there were already 20 to 30 comments on the page lamenting his daughter's death. Eight weeks later, the comments are still coming.",

He said his father had no information at the time he sold the stele to Getty that it might have been illegally removed from Greece.

The number of calories in the daily diets of some participants in this latest study was -- gulp -- 890. Which, by my nonscientific research, is less than the average teenage or adult American who lives within a half mile of a Burger King and has not had gastric bypass surgery consumes for dinner. That might be considered a helpful target, except that it's so ludicrously unattainable, in professions other than modeling and zip codes other than 90210, that there isn't anything helpful about it.",
