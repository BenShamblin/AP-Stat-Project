He was 86, and also had a home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. His wife, Cornelia, announced his death. Although he was a German \u00e9migr\u00e9, Mr. Foss was, from the start of his composing career, considered an important voice in the burgeoning world of American composition, along with Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Elliott Carter and Leonard Bernstein. And like Bernstein, he enthusiastically championed the works of his colleagues. But where Bernstein, in his compositions, melded jazz and theater music with a lush symphonic neo-Romanticism -- or wrote theater music outright -- Mr. Foss preferred to explore the byways of the avant-garde, focusing at different times on techniques from serialism and electronic music to Minimalism and improvisation. But as he moved from style to style, his voice remained distinctive, partly because he distrusted rules and never fully adhered to those of the approaches he adopted, and partly because a current of mercurial wit ran through his work.",

      "lead_paragraph": "WOODBURY--Nathalie Ferris Sampson, of Shutesbury, died December 22 at home after a long illness. She leaves her husband, Richard B. Woodbury and loving friends. Nathalie was born in Humboldt, Arizona in 1918, where she began formal schooling in the sixth grade, and grew into a widely respected scholar and writer. A woman of strong opinions and wit, she delighted in dogs and other animals, which surrounded her at her Shutesbury home. She was an honorary life member of the Nature Conservancy, honorary dog officer of Shutesbury; and a valued supporter of the Dakin Animal Shelter. Her home on the edge of an extensive woodland provided many opportunities to observe wildlife. She attended Barnard College in New York, received her BA degree there in 1939, and pursued graduate studies in Anthropology at Columbia University. She devoted her adult life to the study of human society, languages, and culture in various manifestations, and was the co-author and editor of several volumes in various anthropological sub-disciplines. She married archaeologist Richard Benjamin Woodbury in 1948, and shared field work with him in Mexico, Arizona and New Mexico. The two held museum posts, together and severally in Arizona, New York, and the Smithsonian Institution. In her long career, Nathalie taught at Barnard College, Brooklyn College, Eastern New Mexico College, and the Universities of Arizona and Kentucky. At Barnard she also held administrative positions. In the course of her career she became widely acquainted within the professional ranks of Anthropology and Archaeology, and was universally respected. She was very skillful at editing and authoring, leading to various professional positions. She was editor of several newsletters, contributed a regular column for the Anthropology Newsletter, entitled \"Past is Present,\" and organized and sometimes wrote obituaries for the Newsletter. She was a regular contributor to professional programs, annual reports, and guides. The renown that followed her services led to positions on the Board of the American Anthropological Association, the Society for American Archaeology, and the American Ethnological Society. She edited the internationally respected professional journals for the Society for American Archaeology and the American Anthropological Association. With this background, it is not surprising that she chose anthropologists as 'her people' to study and report. She easily recognized that the familiar was not always well understood, and the exotic was not necessarily foreign. She delighted in 'problem solving' in real world situations, and was able to contribute significantly by applying those skills. Equally adept close to home, she served in town government in Shutesbury as a Selectperson and on the board of the Dakin Animal Shelter. Her skills and vision led her into advocating for a strong executive for the American Anthropological Association. She was instrumental in hiring a business specialist, and watched with deep satisfaction as he drew the Association into fiscal soundness and executive order. Nat was a natural networker. She cared about and maintained close mentoring relationships with former students she had taught at Barnard, Eastern New Mexico, Arizona, and Kentucky. The profession was enriched by their training and skills. At annual professional meetings, she conferred with colleagues and students at luncheons; these relationships frequently blossomed into lifelong friendships. Nathalie and Richard Woodbury were recognized jointly and severally for their significant services for the town and their professional societies. Awards for Distinguished Service were presented by the American Anthropological Association and the Society for American Archaeology. The town of Shutesbury recognized their joint services with a plaque. Close to retirement, Nathalie asked a rhetorical question that sums up a significant career remarkably well: \"Am I an archaeologist or a sociocultural anthropologist?...., an educator, an administrator, or a small town politician?\" She was all of those, and everyone who knew her recognized her gifts and was grateful. Donations in her memory may be made to the Dakin Pioneer Valley Humane Society, P.O. Box 319, South Deerfield, MA 01303. Obituary and register at www.douglassfuneral.com.",
