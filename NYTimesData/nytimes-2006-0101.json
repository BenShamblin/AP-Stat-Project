He was 64. Mr. Milosevic appeared to have died from natural causes, but tribunal officials said they would not be able to give a full account until an autopsy and toxicological report were completed. He was found lifeless on his bed in his cell, a court statement said. Mr. Milosevic's wife, and his partner of almost five decades, Mirjana Markovic, who, like his brother, Borislav, is living in Moscow, was informed of Mr. Milosevic's death, the court said.",

At the very start of her fetching new book, Marilyn Johnson observes that ''people have been slipping out of this world in occupational clusters'' for years: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams famously died within hours of each other on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary to the day of the Declaration of Independence; Paul Winchell, the voice of Tigger in the animated versions of ''Winnie the Pooh,'' and John Fiedler, the voice of Piglet, died a day apart, as did the scientist who isolated vitamin C and the scientist who isolated vitamin K. The Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox passed away on the same day as Samuel Dash, the Senate's chief Watergate counsel, and according to Ms. Johnson, ''Lawrence Welk's trumpeter and his accordion player played a duet out the door.''",

Partly as a result of Risen's revelations, that question now bedevils the Bush administration. It's also one that Isaacson, who is the president and C.E.O. of the Aspen Institute, a public policy center, finds hard to answer. As a former managing editor of Time magazine and chairman of CNN, Isaacson is aware of how the press can and should function, but he is also the author of a biography of Henry Kissinger and the co-author, with Evan Thomas, of ''The Wise Men,'' a study of six policy makers who helped guide the country through the early years of the cold war. ''During my years as a journalist,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''one of the most sensitive issues was balancing security concerns with our instinct to report everything we knew. Now, given the terrorist threat, it's even more difficult. I would be inclined these days to hold back information if it could help terrorists. Yet at a certain point, in a constitutional democracy, you need to debate policies that might lead to torture or unauthorized wiretapping. Journalists have an important role in this process, especially when there is little other oversight.'' The Editors",

Gill Torren, who works as a sales director in the publishing industry and has lived next door to the anchor for two years, doesn't know much about it, either, aside from a local rumor that it was put there by a former sailor in the merchant marine. ''I make up stories about it all the time when people ask, a different one for each person,'' Mr. Torren said the other day. ''Sometimes I say it's Herman Melville's.''",

The expectant faces of all the producers of the five nominated films will be pasted on plasma screens, computers and cellphones around the world, but only one movie will send its producers to the stage to accept that tall gold statue that is the object of so much affection. If the clarion call comes ''And the winner is 'Crash,' '' formidable forces will keep Bob Yari, one of six people listed in the film's opening credits as a producer, off that stage. Only two of the listed producers -- Paul Haggis, who is also the director and co-writer, and Cathy Schulman -- will be eligible for a kiss from the presenter and a statue of their own.",

Actually, it is a mere fragment of a 150-foot-long bronze frieze illustrating the steamship and railroad magnate's accomplishments. Unlike the statue, it has disappeared without a trace. To most people leaving the Holland Tunnel, the wide, barren asphalt spiral between Ericsson Place and Hudson, Varick and Laight Streets is just a wasteland. But in the 1810's, it was one of the most fashionable addresses in New York, or rather the surrounding red brick houses were. The square they bounded was St. John's Park, a landscaped green to which only the householders had keys. Then the fashionable moved farther north, and a railroad line was built down Hudson Street in 1849.",

Mr. Burlingham, on the other hand, ''had no power, no elective office or constituency at the polls,'' George Martin writes in his new biography, ''CCB: The Life and Century of Charles C. Burlingham'' (Hill and Wang, $35), ''but he had influence with many who did, presidents and chief justice of the United States, governors of the state, and mayors of the city, most notably Franklin D. Roosevelt and Fiorello La Guardia.''",
