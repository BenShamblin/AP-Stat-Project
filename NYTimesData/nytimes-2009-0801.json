While Mr. Marshall admitted he was with his friend during that encounter, he withdrew an earlier admission that they were trying to rob the elderly man; Mr. Marshall was never charged with robbery. The obituary also misstated a change in rules of evidence resulting from the case. The prosecution must now fully disclose to the defense any evidence it has; the defense must ensure that full disclosure from the prosecution takes place, and must fully disclose its own evidence only in establishing alibis. The rule change does not mean that both &#8220;the prosecution and the defense must now share evidence fully.&#8221;.",

The ceremonies held on Sunday were to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Poe, the morbidly fixated man of letters, and drew 700 ticket holders as well as many other curious observers, some dressed in period costumes and others in T-shirts that read \u201cEvermore!\u201d (By comparison, fewer than 10 people were reported to have attended Poe\u2019s actual burial in 1849.) The Sun reported that a horse-drawn undertaker\u2019s carriage delivered Poe\u2019s coffin to Westminster Hall, where Poe was memorialized by guest speakers as well as actors portraying Poe\u2019s contemporaries. The actor and author Michael N. Langford, who spoke at the services, told The Sun, \u201cI think Edgar Allan Poe would have been bemused by it, shocked by it. But I think it was what he deserved.\u201d",

As recently as two months ago, at the age of 97, she was helping to prepare an exhibition of more than 100 images that she had taken from the 1960s to the 1980s in her adopted home of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, in the Chiapas highlands of southern Mexico. She died July 26, leaving behind \"an incredible historical and ethnographic document of a time long gone by in this blessed corner of the earth,\" said Janet Schwartz, her friend and executor. That legacy - some 14,000 negatives - is to be housed at the Na Bolom Cultural Association in San Crist\u00f3bal. Ms. Schwartz shared what few photos have been scanned with the Lens blog.",

      "lead_paragraph": "One of the great joys of strolling London - definitely one of the world's greatest cities for aimless wanders - is spotting the city's \"blue plaques,\" signs posted on the facades of buildings that commemorate the lives of those who lived and worked inside. The plaques, which in fact aren't always blue, are themselves objects of beauty, attractively lettered in highly legible fashion and often featuring intricate border designs. Most important, though, they remind the passerby of the incredibly rich historical fabric of this city, viewed through the lens of individuals, some household names, others not, who have called it home. This week, Yale University Press releases \"Lived in London: Blue Plaques and the Stories Behind Them,\" a comprehensive guide to 800 of the plaques arranged by geographic area.The book, which is arranged by geographic area, includes contemporary and archival images as well as lovely illustrated maps detailing where you can find the plaques. Equally enjoyable is the text, which is full of interesting tidbits, like the fact that the critic and biographer Lytton Strachey's lost dissertation was discovered in the basement of his house at 51 Gordon Square more than 30 years after his death, or that the writer H.G. Wells wrote in his own obituary that he occupied \"an old tumble-down house\" on Hanover Terrace when in fact the house was practically luxurious, then and now. There are plenty of entries about fascinating figures you may never have heard of - such as the calligrapher Edward Johnston, whose sans serif font is used for the London Underground's signage - and one of the compelling things about reading an entire section is learning the historical character (bohemian, prosperous, workaday) of individual London neighborhoods, as evidenced by the kind of people who lived there.",
