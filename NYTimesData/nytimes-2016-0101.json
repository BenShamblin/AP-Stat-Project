Arbitrator of labor- management disputes for almost his entire 58 year career, he served as umpire in major industries, including steel, automotive, beverage and government service. Mittenthal wrote many papers on the craft of arbitration, including an oft-cited article on past practice. He served as President of the National Academy of Arbitrators (1978-79) and received a lifetime achievement award from the Michigan Bar in 2015. Raised in NYC, he graduated Cornell University and New York University law school. He was predeceased by his loving wife of 61 years, Joyce Janeway. They married in 1953 and moved to Detroit, MI where he spent the majority of his life and career. He was not only devoted to his work, but to being husband and father. He loved tennis, practiced poetry and was a fervent football fan. The rigor he displayed in his work carried to all aspects of his life. He was driven to know the \"you\" of you, your values, the reasoning underlying them, your deep thoughts. And his courage in sharing all those things about himself encouraged you to feel sufficiently accepted and secure to respond in kind. In his 1979 NAA presidential address, he quipped that he'd experienced a dream where he saw the headline on his own obituary. It read: \"Arbitrator seeks immortality; grievance denied.\" He is survived by four children, Marilyn, Robert, John and Peter, and four grandchildren.

For many, he was the lanky, redheaded and perennially boyish fashion and style reporter for The New York Times, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire and Golf. For others, he was an inspirational practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism: he brought comfort, joy and wisdom to many through his example, his guidance and his two books, \"The Buddha in Your Mirror\" and \"The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror.\" In Sharon, CT, where he had lived since 1993, he was known as a quirky character with memorable pickup trucks (his beautiful golden retriever, Lola, nearly always along for the ride) and a passion for swimming, biking and otherwise enjoying the beauty around him. For his daughter, Kate, he was her biggest cheerleader as well as the person who always encouraged her to set a high standard and then meet it. He adored her, and she adored him. A true journalist, Woody was interested in everything; for the past few years, he was able to travel widely and meet interesting people in the company of his girlfriend, Kirsten Jensen. His daughter and former wife, Cynthia, were glad that he was able to enrich his life and expand his horizons with Kirsten before his death, from a glioblastoma tumor, on December 31. For a full obituary and details of his January 17 memorial service in Lakeville, CT, go to his memorial website at www.forevermissed.com. 1/3",
