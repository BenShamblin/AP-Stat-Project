Born in a small village in St. Ann's Parish, Jamaica, WI, Dr. Joseph, as she was known professionally, came to the United States through Ellis Island in 1919. She attended George Washington High School in New York City and won a scholarship to Barnard. She was one of the first African-American graduates of Barnard College where she earned Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated in 1932. Dr. Joseph earned her medical school degree at the College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia University graduating AOA in 1936. She subsequently did an internship at Harlem Hospital. In 1938, she married Dr. Jerome S. Peterson, also a graduate of Columbia University Physicians & Surgeons graduate of 1931. From 1940 to 1942, they lived in Puerto Rico where they managed several tuberculosis clinics. Returning to New York, Dr. Joseph was a physician and assistant to the director at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union Health Center. In 1950 the family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, where Dr. Joseph was an assistant professor of medicine at the American University of Beirut while her husband worked with the United Nations. The family relocated to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1953 when her husband accepted a position with the World Health Organization. In Geneva, Dr. Joseph was active with the Medical Women's International Association and served as its honorary secretary. She was a member of the Governing Board of the International School, and in 1958 became consultant to the European regional Office of WHO for the advisory group on public health and aging. The couple returned to the United States in 1964, settling in Amherst, Massachusetts. Dr. Joseph assumed a position with the Smith College Health Service, where she eventually rose to become Director. In 1974 she and her husband were co-recipients of the Ira Hiscock award for contributions in public health from the New England Public Health Association. She retired in 1975 from Smith College Health Service. Dr. Joseph served as a Trustee of the Jones Library and the Amherst Savings Bank, Board of Overseers of Williston-Northampton School and on the Health Services Advisory Council of the College of Physicians & Surgeons. Her husband died in 1987, and she founded the Vera Joseph/Jerome S. Peterson Fund for Minority Students at the College of Physicians & Surgeons to honor his memory. Dr. Joseph eventually moved from Amherst to Reeds Landing, a retirement community in Springfield. Vera Joseph Peterson is survived by three daughters; Jane Peterson of Seattle, Washington, Danna Peterson of Worcester, Massachusetts, and Carla Rosenbloom of Washington, D.C., four grandchildren; Claire Roberts of Spokane, Washington, Sarah Rosenbloom of New York City, Julia Rosenbloom of Philadelphia, and Philip Peterson of Worcester, and one greatgrandchild, Jacob Roberts of Spokane. A Memorial Mass will be held on Friday, February 1, at 11:00am in St. Brigid's Church in Amherst. Burial will follow in Wildwood Cemetery. Obituary and register at: douglassfuneral.com",

      "lead_paragraph": "PETERSON--Vera Joseph, died peacefully Saturday, January 26, 2008, in Springfield, Massachusetts. She was 98. Born in a small village in St. Ann's Parish, Jamaica, WI, Dr. Joseph, as she was known professionally, came to the United States through Ellis Island in 1919. She attended George Washington High School in New York City and won a scholarship to Barnard. She was one of the first African-American graduates of Barnard College where she earned Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated in 1932. Dr. Joseph earned her medical school degree at the College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia University graduating AOA in 1936. She subsequently did an internship at Harlem Hospital. In 1938, she married Dr. Jerome S. Peterson, also a graduate of Columbia University Physicians & Surgeons graduate of 1931. From 1940 to 1942, they lived in Puerto Rico where they managed several tuberculosis clinics. Returning to New York, Dr. Joseph was a physician and assistant to the director at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union Health Center. In 1950 the family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, where Dr. Joseph was an assistant professor of medicine at the American University of Beirut while her husband worked with the United Nations. The family relocated to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1953 when her husband accepted a position with the World Health Organization. In Geneva, Dr. Joseph was active with the Medical Women's International Association and served as its honorary secretary. She was a member of the Governing Board of the International School, and in 1958 became consultant to the European regional Office of WHO for the advisory group on public health and aging. The couple returned to the United States in 1964, settling in Amherst, Massachusetts. Dr. Joseph assumed a position with the Smith College Health Service, where she eventually rose to become Director. In 1974 she and her husband were co-recipients of the Ira Hiscock award for contributions in public health from the New England Public Health Association. She retired in 1975 from Smith College Health Service. Dr. Joseph served as a Trustee of the Jones Library and the Amherst Savings Bank, Board of Overseers of Williston-Northampton School and on the Health Services Advisory Council of the College of Physicians & Surgeons. Her husband died in 1987, and she founded the Vera Joseph/Jerome S. Peterson Fund for Minority Students at the College of Physicians & Surgeons to honor his memory. Dr. Joseph eventually moved from Amherst to Reeds Landing, a retirement community in Springfield. Vera Joseph Peterson is survived by three daughters; Jane Peterson of Seattle, Washington, Danna Peterson of Worcester, Massachusetts, and Carla Rosenbloom of Washington, D.C., four grandchildren; Claire Roberts of Spokane, Washington, Sarah Rosenbloom of New York City, Julia Rosenbloom of Philadelphia, and Philip Peterson of Worcester, and one greatgrandchild, Jacob Roberts of Spokane. A Memorial Mass will be held on Friday, February 1, at 11:00am in St. Brigid's Church in Amherst. Burial will follow in Wildwood Cemetery.
