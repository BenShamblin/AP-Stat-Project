Its lyrics called for men to use condoms (''socks'') to prevent AIDS, and it stirred up controversy; Radio Tanzania refused to play it. But it became one of Mr. Ongala's best-known songs in a career as Tanzania's most beloved and influential musician, on and off the dance floor, with songs that had both a groove and a conscience. He sang serious thoughts about poverty, corruption, mortality, faith and Tanzanian pride, and he called his music ''ubongo beat'' -- ''ubongo'' is Swahili for ''brain.''",

It has a handsomely decorated front-panel that swings around on a lazy susan to reveal a collection of whiskey glasses and decanters on the other side. It's what's sometimes called a hide-a-bar, though we use it now mainly as a place to charge our cellphones. We keep it prominently displayed because we like it. But it also oddly embodies the split life of my mother-in-law, from whom we inherited it. And it has lately shaped the course of my own life both as a writer and a son-in-law.",
