Only I can write them, knowing well that when finished, it can never be sufficient. Nothing could be. By necessity I must confine myself to a flyspeck perspective of a man with formidable combinations. By nature my father was affable, accommodating, an inveterate optimist -a ''Lebenskunstler''... how else could he have survived those twenty years, from the Great Depression until a few years after WWII, as a registered architect (in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania) with the U.S. building industry flat on its back? He was a man of cheerful humor, who delighted in his family, humanity, life ... and limericks. As a Pied Piper his limber-fingered magic tricks not only astounded children, they also taught them about physics. This music lover was a devotee of symphonic works, grand opera, operettas and was an accomplished pianist. My father was adroit with languages: English (adopted 1907 as his first language,) French, German (his mother tongue,) Latin, ancient Greek, and Nez Perce. An antiquity buff, he met every fortnight, eventually only once a month, with friends (Arnold Brecht, Irwin Edman, Ernest Fox, Gunter Keil, Theodore de Postels, etc.) to sight translate Latin and/or ancient Greek texts. Besides a multitude of other interests he was a devoted husband and a truly splendid parent. His modesty, polished manners, gallantry, unstinting time for his ''two girls'', is what my mother, Rosa Louise Frieling, nee Thollembeek (+ 04-12-02), and I missed most when he suddenly died of a massive heart attack fifty years ago. He gave us anchorage, perspective, and direction. To you, Dad, a fusillade of thank-yous -I shall always follow your tenets.",

Michael was born on September 23, 1927 to Leo George Hadley Jr. and Marsulite Nolker Hadley in St. Louis, Missouri. He also resided in Evanston, IL and Greenwich, CT. Michael married Gladys Pauline (Polly) Rolwing on October 16, 1954 at the Annunziata Catholic Church in St Louis, Missouri. He graduated from New Trier High School in Evanston, Illinois and received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He then went on to work: in the Foreign Service in West Berlin and Moscow, Hadley Dean Glass Company in St. Louis, Curtis Publishing Company in St. Louis, Times Mirror Magazines, Inc. in New York City, The Sporting News in St. Louis, and Veronis Suhler and Associates in New York City. He was also a member of the Magazine Publishers Association and served on the Board of Directors for the Falstaff Brewery in St. Louis. He also served on the Board of Directors for the Animas Foundation in southern New Mexico. When Michael was editor of his grammar school yearbook he won an award for best layout and design. It was an award he treasured all his life. It foreshadowed his success in Publishing. He was also an avid swimmer and was on the Varsity Swim team at New Trier High School. He also enjoyed sailing and body surfing. He is survived by his children Martha Christine (Polly) Ruff, Nancy Stewart Hadley, Sally Catherine Hadley, and Laura Nolker Hadley. His siblings Leo George Hadley III, Ann Schmick Jewett and Mary Schmick. Grandchildren Jeremy David Ruff, Jacob Michael Ruff, Chelsea Christine Ruff, Boyd Easton Bissell Jr. and Hadley Brodhead Bissell. Other survivors include Edward G. Rolwing and John M. Rolwing. He is preceded in death by his wife Gladys Pauline (Polly) who passed away on September 2, 1971, and his brother William Schmick. Michael was more than a father to his four daughters: he was a ''daddy''. He was always ready to shop, get ice cream, go to the beach, and help with homework. The neighborhood was often at the house. He was a mentor, peacemaker and problem solver. He made each day, no matter how hectic or ordinary, extraordinary and fun. Visitation will be on Friday, December 14 at 10:00am at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, 7148 Forsyth Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 63105. Catholic services will follow. Reverend Monsignor Edward J. Sudekum will be officiating. Interment will be at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, MO. Contributions may be made at www.malpaiborderlandsgroup.org or The Animas Foundation, 14 Diamond A Drive, Animas, NM 88020. A formal obituary will follow at a later date.",

Michael was born on September 23, 1927 to Leo George Hadley Jr. and Marsulite Nolker Hadley in St. Louis, Missouri. He also resided in Evanston, IL and Greenwich, CT. Michael married Gladys Pauline (Polly) Rolwing on October 16, 1954 at the Annunziata Catholic Church in St Louis, Missouri. He graduated from New Trier High School in Evanston, Illinois and received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He then went on to work: in the Foreign Service in West Berlin and Moscow, Hadley Dean Glass Company in St. Louis, Curtis Publishing Company in St. Louis, Times Mirror Magazines, Inc. in New York City, The Sporting News in St. Louis, and Veronis Suhler and Associates in New York City. He was also a member of the Magazine Publishers Association and served on the Board of Directors for the Falstaff Brewery in St. Louis. He also served on the Board of Directors for the Animas Foundation in southern New Mexico. When Michael was editor of his grammar school yearbook he won an award for best layout and design. It was an award he treasured all his life. It foreshadowed his success in Publishing. He was also an avid swimmer and was on the Varsity Swim team at New Trier High School. He also enjoyed sailing and body surfing. He is survived by his children Martha Christine (Polly) Ruff, Nancy Stewart Hadley, Sally Catherine Hadley, and Laura Nolker Hadley. His siblings Leo George Hadley III, Ann Schmick Jewett and Mary Schmick. Grandchildren Jeremy David Ruff, Jacob Michael Ruff, Chelsea Christine Ruff, Boyd Easton Bissell Jr. and Hadley Brodhead Bissell. Other survivors include Edward G. Rolwing and John M. Rolwing. He is preceded in death by his wife Gladys Pauline (Polly) who passed away on September 2, 1971, and his brother William Schmick. Michael was more than a father to his four daughters: he was a \"daddy\". He was always ready to shop, get ice cream, go to the beach, and help with homework. The neighborhood was often at the house. He was a mentor, peacemaker and problem solver. He made each day, no matter how hectic or ordinary, extraordinary and fun. Visitation will be on Friday, December 14 at 10:00am at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, 7148 Forsyth Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 63105. Catholic services will follow. Reverend Monsignor Edward J. Sudekum will be officiating. Interment will be at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, MO.
