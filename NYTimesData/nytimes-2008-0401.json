Lewis & Sons, 1010 Bering Drive in Houston. The memorial service will be conducted at eleven o'clock in the morning on Monday, the 21st of July, in the sanctuary of Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church, 11612 Memorial Drive in Houston, where the Rev. Dr. David Peterson, Pastor, will serve as the lead officiant. Immediately following the service, all are invited to join the family for a reception in the adjacent narthex of the church. Services in Houston are entrusted to Geo. H. Lewis & Sons The Funeral Directors Since 1936, 713.789.3005. In lieu of usual remembrances, contributions in memory of Mr. Roy M.
