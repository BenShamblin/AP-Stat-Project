''It's as though everything in 'Hair' turned into a nightmare,'' the executive producer of the original Broadway production, Bertrand Castelli, said in a recent documentary film about the show, ''Hair: Let the Sun Shine In.''

Mr. Bentley's recollection is unsupported by other existing historical records. The obituary also described Mr. Bentley's role in the arrest imprecisely. Mr. Bentley adjusted the handcuffs after Oswald complained they were too tight; he did not snap the handcuffs on. (Another officer had placed his handcuffs on Oswald moments earlier.)",

Born in Boulogne, France to parents Colette and Claude Aubert, Corinne grew up moving around France with her two sisters Laurence and Nathalie. She began studying in Hippocagne but her powerful, charismatic character drove her towards bigger and better things. She proceeded to complete her bachelor's degrees in Art History and Literature. She met my father, Kevin Goering, in Bordeaux where he was studying the French language. Together, they packed up and ventured to America to begin a new life in the Promised Land. My mother proceeded to begin her work at Yves Saint Laurent, Rive Gauche. She ended her 20 year career in the fashion industry when I, demanding little toddler that I was, kept her home for myself. Mom was a beautiful, intelligent and energetic woman. She particularly enjoyed dragging me on long walks in the wilderness of the Catskills as well as teaching and helping others. This year, she was working with the old and dying to put a stop to suffering and pain. She was full of generosity and compassion for people in general because of how much she had been through herself; she was a tough cookie. This is the one thing she couldn't get through. I write this today with a hint of humor and uplifting thoughts because I do not wish for her to be remembered because she died, but because of the beautiful life that she led. She left a deep impact on all of those people that she encountered in her lifetime and I can only aspire to be like her; my mother, ma maman.",
