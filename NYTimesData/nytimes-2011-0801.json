In each of these obituaries was a phrase that read something like this: ''The first black American to . . .'' or ''The first African-American .''",

Bernstein. It is difficult to write an obituary about someone who still lives. Elayne Polly Bernstein Schwartz passed away in Lenox, Massachusetts on October 4, 2011 from cancer. Born in the Bronx on October 29, 1924, she always liked to explain that she was conceived in China. Her parents, Jack Polly and Jean Morrison, returned from China to the U.S. to ensure Elayne's American citizenship. After spending her early years in China (where she learned lullabies she would later sing to her children), Elayne moved with her family to Brooklyn. After the death of her mother when Elayne was thirteen, her two aunts joined the household and jointly raised their children, including Elayne's older brother Sydney and her cousin Eileen, whom she regarded as a sister. From this experience, Elayne developed an unshakeable belief in the importance of family and extended family. Elayne was also a talented singer and actress. While at Erasmus Hall High School, she cut school one day in order to win the Betty Hutton Contest of Brooklyn. After graduation, she worked as a singer, performing on 52nd Street at the Zebra Club, and at the Onyx Club (she later called them \"dens of iniquity\") on the same bill with Lenny Bruce. After her marriage to high school sweetheart Harold Bernstein, Elayne moved to Great Neck, NY, in 1948, where she raised her five children. She served as a leader of the Free Nurses Institute of the Julia Bernstein League and was active in civic affairs, especially the effort to desegregate Great Neck Public Schools. Proud of her Jewish heritage, she was for many years an active member of both Temple Israel and Temple Beth El, starring in musical theater and singing in the High Holiday choirs. She proudly joined Beth El's first adult Bat Mitzvah class well after her five children had achieved this major milestone in their lives. And she was an ardent supporter of the Jewish Studies Program at Queens College. Her decision to enter Queens College as an adult mother of five was, she said, the most monumental one of her life, setting her on a path of education, inquiry and passionate engagement with the world of ideas, theater, art and music. She earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree (the latter magna cum laude), but her voracious appetite for education continued throughout her life and inspired her decades-long service as President of the Board of the Great Neck Public Library. She also privately supported the educational aspirations of disadvantaged children, enabling them to pursue successful careers in music and art. Her commitment to ORT led to the creation of the Elayne Bernstein Auditorium in Kiryat Yam, Israel to provide science and technology education to Ethiopian and Russian immigrant children. In conjunction with Peace Now, she sponsored two annual conferences in Lenox in which Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met to work on peace issues. Her sense of justice made her a truly righteous person. Elayne put her master's degree to work as an administrator at Queens College, where she was especially proud of organizing a 1985 conference on homosexuality and family life at the start of the AIDS epidemic, despite considerable disapproval. Most notably, she co-developed Backstage at the Berkshires, an adult education program at Queens designed to introduce the cultural treasures of the area to participants, with Shakespeare & Company as the crown jewel and the cultural/educational love of her life. Elayne supported Shakespeare productions everywhere she found them (becoming, for example, an ardent supporter of New York's Theater for a New Audience.) In Lenox Elayne served on the Board of Shakespeare and Company, working tirelessly to enable the organization to extend the reach of Shakespeare to everyone, especially young people. She was evangelical in her belief that Shakespeare speaks to us all. As a result of her devotion and support, Shakespeare and Company dedicated the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater (2009), the Bernstein Production Center, and, in 2011, Elayne's Corner, a garden that greets audience members on their way inside. Through her immersion in the cultural and artistic life of Lenox, Elayne met, fell in love with, and at age 80 married (in 2004) Sol Schwartz, and together they forged a joyous life of common interests in the arts, culture and education. Elayne is survived by her husband, Sol Schwartz; her cousin/sister Eileen Weinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Gene and Pamela Bernstein and their daughters, Jennifer Bernstein and Mindy Feinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Jay and Jill Bernstein and their children Julie Packin, Samantha Bernstein and Jamie Bernstein; her daughter Donna Bernstein and son Samuel Bernstein; her daughter and son-in-law Linda and Tony Rubin and their children Jacob and Gena Rubin; her son and daughter-in-law Matthew and Natalie Bernstein and their children Justin and Adam Bernstein; her grandsons-in-law Mark Feinberg and Ari Packin; her great-grandchildren Eliza and Jack Feinberg and Hallie Rose and Charlie Packin; and Sol Schwartz's children David and Risa Schwartz, and his grandson John. A memorial celebration will be held in the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater at Shakespeare & Company at 70 Kemble Street in Lenox, Massachusetts on Sunday, October 9, 2011 at 2pm. In lieu of flowers, it was Elayne's wish that memorial contributions be made to Shakespeare & Company (70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA, 01240) or to HospiceCare in the Berkshires, Inc. (877 South Street, Suite 1 West, Pittsfield, MA 01201. Everyone who met Elayne benefitted from her engaging smile, capacious heart, her superb ability to listen without judgment and provide wise advice, and her joyous sense of life. Many more benefited from her generosity without having the privilege of meeting her. To the very end of her life, she remained a woman of untrammeled honesty, integrity and hope. Her interests in the world and the people in it can only be described as all-encompassing, all-embracing and life affirming. It is for these many reasons that Elayne lives on.<br><br>\n ",

That all the rules changes over the past three decades had left us with a game that looks more like the Arena Football League. Then Week 6 came. You might have heard that the first four weeks of this year featured the four highest single-week passing yardage totals in league history. That was a little misleading, as each of those weeks had 32 teams playing, which was not the case for most of league history. But even on a per-game basis, the first four -- and then the fifth -- weeks of this season had huge passing numbers. In the first four weeks, the average team gained 246 passing yards and scored 22.8 points per game. In Week 5, the 26 teams playing averaged 239 passing yards and 25 points per game. But this past week, while the average team passed for 232 passing yards, scoring dropped to 20.1 points. And that drop in points can be attributed to the drop in passing touchdowns. There were 54 passing touchdowns in Week 1, and another 54 in Week 2. Last week -- the first with teams on byes -- 26 teams passed for 45 touchdowns, an even higher average per team game (1.73) than in the first two weeks. But the 26 teams this past weekend passed for only 27 touchdowns, and that includes the fake-field goal touchdown pass from Oakland punter Shane Lechler. In each of the first two weeks, 18 teams had at least two touchdown passes. This weekend, only 7 of the 24 teams threw for multiple touchdowns.",

      "lead_paragraph": "SCHWARTZ--Elayne P. Bernstein. It is difficult to write an obituary about someone who still lives. Elayne Polly Bernstein Schwartz passed away in Lenox, Massachusetts on October 4, 2011 from cancer. Born in the Bronx on October 29, 1924, she always liked to explain that she was conceived in China. Her parents, Jack Polly and Jean Morrison, returned from China to the U.S. to ensure Elayne's American citizenship. After spending her early years in China (where she learned lullabies she would later sing to her children), Elayne moved with her family to Brooklyn. After the death of her mother when Elayne was thirteen, her two aunts joined the household and jointly raised their children, including Elayne's older brother Sydney and her cousin Eileen, whom she regarded as a sister. From this experience, Elayne developed an unshakeable belief in the importance of family and extended family. Elayne was also a talented singer and actress. While at Erasmus Hall High School, she cut school one day in order to win the Betty Hutton Contest of Brooklyn. After graduation, she worked as a singer, performing on 52nd Street at the Zebra Club, and at the Onyx Club (she later called them \"dens of iniquity\") on the same bill with Lenny Bruce. After her marriage to high school sweetheart Harold Bernstein, Elayne moved to Great Neck, NY, in 1948, where she raised her five children. She served as a leader of the Free Nurses Institute of the Julia Bernstein League and was active in civic affairs, especially the effort to desegregate Great Neck Public Schools. Proud of her Jewish heritage, she was for many years an active member of both Temple Israel and Temple Beth El, starring in musical theater and singing in the High Holiday choirs. She proudly joined Beth El's first adult Bat Mitzvah class well after her five children had achieved this major milestone in their lives. And she was an ardent supporter of the Jewish Studies Program at Queens College. Her decision to enter Queens College as an adult mother of five was, she said, the most monumental one of her life, setting her on a path of education, inquiry and passionate engagement with the world of ideas, theater, art and music. She earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree (the latter magna cum laude), but her voracious appetite for education continued throughout her life and inspired her decades-long service as President of the Board of the Great Neck Public Library. She also privately supported the educational aspirations of disadvantaged children, enabling them to pursue successful careers in music and art. Her commitment to ORT led to the creation of the Elayne Bernstein Auditorium in Kiryat Yam, Israel to provide science and technology education to Ethiopian and Russian immigrant children. In conjunction with Peace Now, she sponsored two annual conferences in Lenox in which Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met to work on peace issues. Her sense of justice made her a truly righteous person. Elayne put her master's degree to work as an administrator at Queens College, where she was especially proud of organizing a 1985 conference on homosexuality and family life at the start of the AIDS epidemic, despite considerable disapproval. Most notably, she co-developed Backstage at the Berkshires, an adult education program at Queens designed to introduce the cultural treasures of the area to participants, with Shakespeare & Company as the crown jewel and the cultural/educational love of her life. Elayne supported Shakespeare productions everywhere she found them (becoming, for example, an ardent supporter of New York's Theater for a New Audience.) In Lenox Elayne served on the Board of Shakespeare and Company, working tirelessly to enable the organization to extend the reach of Shakespeare to everyone, especially young people. She was evangelical in her belief that Shakespeare speaks to us all. As a result of her devotion and support, Shakespeare and Company dedicated the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater (2009), the Bernstein Production Center, and, in 2011, Elayne's Corner, a garden that greets audience members on their way inside. Through her immersion in the cultural and artistic life of Lenox, Elayne met, fell in love with, and at age 80 married (in 2004) Sol Schwartz, and together they forged a joyous life of common interests in the arts, culture and education. Elayne is survived by her husband, Sol Schwartz; her cousin/sister Eileen Weinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Gene and Pamela Bernstein and their daughters, Jennifer Bernstein and Mindy Feinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Jay and Jill Bernstein and their children Julie Packin, Samantha Bernstein and Jamie Bernstein; her daughter Donna Bernstein and son Samuel Bernstein; her daughter and son-in-law Linda and Tony Rubin and their children Jacob and Gena Rubin; her son and daughter-in-law Matthew and Natalie Bernstein and their children Justin and Adam Bernstein; her grandsons-in-law Mark Feinberg and Ari Packin; her great-grandchildren Eliza and Jack Feinberg and Hallie Rose and Charlie Packin; and Sol Schwartz's children David and Risa Schwartz, and his grandson John. A memorial celebration will be held in the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater at Shakespeare & Company at 70 Kemble Street in Lenox, Massachusetts on Sunday, October 9, 2011 at 2pm. In lieu of flowers, it was Elayne's wish that memorial contributions be made to Shakespeare & Company (70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA, 01240) or to HospiceCare in the Berkshires, Inc. (877 South Street, Suite 1 West, Pittsfield, MA 01201. Everyone who met Elayne benefitted from her engaging smile, capacious heart, her superb ability to listen without judgment and provide wise advice, and her joyous sense of life. Many more benefited from her generosity without having the privilege of meeting her. To the very end of her life, she remained a woman of untrammeled honesty, integrity and hope. Her interests in the world and the people in it can only be described as all-encompassing, all-embracing and life affirming. It is for these many reasons that Elayne lives on.",

      "lead_paragraph": "SCHWARTZ--Elayne P. Bernstein. It is difficult to write an obituary about someone who still lives. Elayne Polly Bernstein Schwartz passed away in Lenox, Massachusetts on October 4, 2011 from cancer. Born in the Bronx on October 29, 1924, she always liked to explain that she was conceived in China. Her parents, Jack Polly and Jean Morrison, returned from China to the U.S. to ensure Elayne's American citizenship. After spending her early years in China (where she learned lullabies she would later sing to her children), Elayne moved with her family to Brooklyn. After the death of her mother when Elayne was thirteen, her two aunts joined the household and jointly raised their children, including Elayne's older brother Sydney and her cousin Eileen, whom she regarded as a sister. From this experience, Elayne developed an unshakeable belief in the importance of family and extended family. Elayne was also a talented singer and actress. While at Erasmus Hall High School, she cut school one day in order to win the Betty Hutton Contest of Brooklyn. After graduation, she worked as a singer, performing on 52nd Street at the Zebra Club, and at the Onyx Club (she later called them \"dens of iniquity\") on the same bill with Lenny Bruce. After her marriage to high school sweetheart Harold Bernstein, Elayne moved to Great Neck, NY, in 1948, where she raised her five children. She served as a leader of the Free Nurses Institute of the Julia Bernstein League and was active in civic affairs, especially the effort to desegregate Great Neck Public Schools. Proud of her Jewish heritage, she was for many years an active member of both Temple Israel and Temple Beth El, starring in musical theater and singing in the High Holiday choirs. She proudly joined Beth El's first adult Bat Mitzvah class well after her five children had achieved this major milestone in their lives. And she was an ardent supporter of the Jewish Studies Program at Queens College. Her decision to enter Queens College as an adult mother of five was, she said, the most monumental one of her life, setting her on a path of education, inquiry and passionate engagement with the world of ideas, theater, art and music. She earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree (the latter magna cum laude), but her voracious appetite for education continued throughout her life and inspired her decades-long service as President of the Board of the Great Neck Public Library. She also privately supported the educational aspirations of disadvantaged children, enabling them to pursue successful careers in music and art. Her commitment to ORT led to the creation of the Elayne Bernstein Auditorium in Kiryat Yam, Israel to provide science and technology education to Ethiopian and Russian immigrant children. In conjunction with Peace Now, she sponsored two annual conferences in Lenox in which Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met to work on peace issues. Her sense of justice made her a truly righteous person. Elayne put her master's degree to work as an administrator at Queens College, where she was especially proud of organizing a 1985 conference on homosexuality and family life at the start of the AIDS epidemic, despite considerable disapproval. Most notably, she co-developed Backstage at the Berkshires, an adult education program at Queens designed to introduce the cultural treasures of the area to participants, with Shakespeare & Company as the crown jewel and the cultural/educational love of her life. Elayne supported Shakespeare productions everywhere she found them (becoming, for example, an ardent supporter of New York's Theater for a New Audience.) In Lenox Elayne served on the Board of Shakespeare and Company, working tirelessly to enable the organization to extend the reach of Shakespeare to everyone, especially young people. She was evangelical in her belief that Shakespeare speaks to us all. As a result of her devotion and support, Shakespeare and Company dedicated the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater (2009), the Bernstein Production Center, and, in 2011, Elayne's Corner, a garden that greets audience members on their way inside. Through her immersion in the cultural and artistic life of Lenox, Elayne met, fell in love with, and at age 80 married (in 2004) Sol Schwartz, and together they forged a joyous life of common interests in the arts, culture and education. Elayne is survived by her husband, Sol Schwartz; her cousin/sister Eileen Weinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Gene and Pamela Bernstein and their daughters, Jennifer Bernstein and Mindy Feinberg; her son and daughter-in-law Jay and Jill Bernstein and their children Julie Packin, Samantha Bernstein and Jamie Bernstein; her daughter Donna Bernstein and son Samuel Bernstein; her daughter and son-in-law Linda and Tony Rubin and their children Jacob and Gena Rubin; her son and daughter-in-law Matthew and Natalie Bernstein and their children Justin and Adam Bernstein; her grandsons-in-law Mark Feinberg and Ari Packin; her great-grandchildren Eliza and Jack Feinberg and Hallie Rose and Charlie Packin; and Sol Schwartz's children David and Risa Schwartz, and his grandson John. A memorial celebration will be held in the Elayne P. Bernstein Theater at Shakespeare & Company at 70 Kemble Street in Lenox, Massachusetts on Sunday, October 9, 2011 at 2pm. In lieu of flowers, it was Elayne's wish that memorial contributions be made to Shakespeare & Company (70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA, 01240) or to HospiceCare in the Berkshires, Inc. (877 South Street, Suite 1 West, Pittsfield, MA 01201. Everyone who met Elayne benefitted from her engaging smile, capacious heart, her superb ability to listen without judgment and provide wise advice, and her joyous sense of life. Many more benefited from her generosity without having the privilege of meeting her. To the very end of her life, she remained a woman of untrammeled honesty, integrity and hope. Her interests in the world and the people in it can only be described as all-encompassing, all-embracing and life affirming. It is for these many reasons that Elayne lives on.",

The knockout punch was delivered in Week 7. After teams averaged over 240 passing yards per game through the first six weeks of the season, the 26 teams playing in Week 7 combined for only 4,997 passing yards this past weekend, a paltry 191 yards per game. Nowhere was this more evident -- on Sunday -- than in Cleveland, as the Seahawks and Browns put on a pitiful display. The Browns and Seahawks combined for 435 yards and 9 points. It was the worst display of offense in a game not affected by severe weather in over a decade. The Colt McCoy pass attempt watch marches on: he threw 35 passes in a game in which the Browns allowed only 137 yards and 3 points.",

Baltimore had nine drives in the first half, and the Ravens never got close to getting a first down on any of them. Four of Jacksonville's first-half possessions gained negative yards; a fifth series ended in a fumble. After 30 minutes, the game featured five fumbles, four first downs and just 29 yards of passing. Baltimore got its first first down with five minutes left in the third quarter. The two teams combined for 185 passing yards, the fewest in any game this season. Joe Flacco threw for only 137 yards on 38 pass attempts; only Jesse Palmer, Bobby Hoying, Kent Graham, Carson Palmer and Tommy Maddox have gained fewer yards on so many attempts since 1970. The Jaguars rookie quarterback Blaine Gabbert wasn't any better -- the Jaguars gained 73 passing yards on 24 pass plays. Once again, don't write the obituary on pass defense just yet.",
